# juego-Alpha-zero

This repository was developed as a university project, which is a mini-game in Java in which two horses (Black and White) compete to eat a certain number of apples on a chessboard with dimensions of 6*6. The user controls the Black horse, while the logic of the program controls the White horse. Just like in chess, the horses can only make L-shaped moves, and the winner of the game is the one who eats the greater number of apples. The game logic employs a heuristic based on movements supported by a decision tree to make moves on the board autonomously.

# How Run

To run the application, you must have some version of Java installed on your machine. You can open the project with an IDE and execute the "StartGame" class to begin playing.
